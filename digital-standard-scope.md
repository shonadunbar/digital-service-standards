While the information and guidance within the Digital Service Design Guide will be useful for teams in all services, the standard itself will not apply to all government services. As described in the e-Government and Digital Economy Policy, only high-volume services released from [month] 2015 must meet it.
 
##Transaction services
 
To establish whether your service must meet the service standard, ask yourself if your service is:
 - completely new and/or being redesigned?
 - processing (or likely to process) more than 50,000 transactions every year?
 - the responsibility of a government department, agency or government business enterprise?
 
If you have answered yes to all questions then the service must meet the standard before it can go live from [month] 2015 and commence dashboard reporting.
 
If you have an existing service that:
 - processes more than 50,000 transactions every year; and
 - is the responsibility of a government department, agency or government business enterprise
 
then your service will need to adopt the standard by end of 2017 and provide a plan by [month] 2015 on how you will transition to the standard; progress will be monitored.
 
If you have answered no to one or more of these questions then your service does not have to meet the standard.
 
##Digital information as a service
 

To establish whether your information (including all websites and publications) must meet the service standard, ask yourself if the information is:
 - completely new and/or being redesigned or redeveloped?
 - the responsibility of a government department, agency or government business enterprise?
 
If you have answered yes to all questions then the information must meet the standard before it can go live from [month] 2015.
 
Existing information will need to adopt the standard by end of 2017 and agencies must provide a plan by [month] 2015 on how they will transition all information to the standard progress will be monitored.
 
##Why the standard doesnâ€™t apply to everything
 
Government services cover a vast variety of activity, from the mainstream to the highly specialised. Applying the standard to services dealing with a handful of transactions is likely to have fewer benefits.
 
Similarly government information covers a vast variety of platforms servicing clients with differing abilities, these clients needs will be identified as part of the service discovery phase. Users of government services who cannot interact or transact digitally will need to be supported.
 
The standard represents best practice so you may like to consider adopting relevant parts.
