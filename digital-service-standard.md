##Digital Service Standard
The Australian Government Digital Service Standard is modelled off the UK Government’s Digital by Default service standard. It establishes the best practices for high quality new or redesigned digital services. The standard will be supported by a Digital Service Design Guide to help agencies design trusted, cost-effective government services that are embraced by users and meet their needs first time. Before any new or redesigned service can be launched within the scope of the standard it must meet the criteria set out in the standard.


1.	**Understand user needs** – conduct research to develop a deep knowledge of who the service users are and what that means for digital and assisted digital service design.

2.	**Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team** that can design, build and operate the service, led by a suitably skilled and senior service manager with decision-making responsibility.

3.	**Evaluate what user data and information the service will be providing or storing**, and address the security level, legal responsibilities, and risks associated with the service (consulting with experts where appropriate).

4.	**&Evaluate the privacy risks** to make sure that personal data collection requirements are appropriate.

5.	**Evaluate what tools and systems** will be used to build, host, operate and measure a service, and how to procure them.

6.	**Build the service using the agile**, iterative and user-centred methods set out in the design guide.

7.	**Establish performance benchmarks**, in consultation with Finance and Communications, using the 4 key performance indicators (KPIs) defined in the design guide, against which the service will be measured.

8.	**Analyse the prototype service’s success**, and translate user feedback into features and tasks for the next phase of development.

9.	**Create a service that is simple and intuitive** enough that users succeed first time, unaided.

10.	**Put appropriate assisted digital support** in place that’s aimed towards those who genuinely need it.

11.	**Plan for the phasing out** of any existing alternative channels, where appropriate.

12.	**Integrate the service with any non-digital sections** required for legal reasons.

13.	**Build a service with the same look, feel and tone** as [to be determined], using the Digital Service Design Guide.

14.	**Make sure that you have the capacity and technical flexibility** to update and improve the service on a frequent basis.

15.	**Make all new source code open and reuseable**, and publish it under appropriate licences (or provide a convincing explanation as to why this cannot be done for specific subsets of the source code).

16.	**Use open standards and common government solutions** (e.g. identity assurance) where available.

17.	**Be able to test the end-to-end service** in an environment identical to that of the live version on all common browsers and devices. Use dummy accounts and a representative sample of users.

18.	**Use analytics tools** that collect performance data.

19.	**Build a service that can be iterated** on a frequent basis and make sure resources are in place to do so.

20.	**Put a plan in place for ongoing user research and usability testing** to continuously seek feedback from users.

21.	**Establish a benchmark for user satisfaction** across the digital and assisted digital service. Report performance data on the Performance Dashboard.

22.	**Establish a benchmark for completion rates** across the digital and assisted digital service. Report performance data on the Performance Dashboard.

23.	**Create a plan (with supporting evidence) for achieving a low cost per transaction** across the digital and assisted digital service. Report performance data on the Performance Dashboard.

24.	**Create a plan (with supporting evidence) for achieving a high digital take-up** and assisted digital support for users who really need it. Report performance data on the Performance Dashboard.

25.	**Create a business continuity plan** in the event of the service being taken temporarily offline.

26.	Successfully **test the service from beginning to end** with the Minister responsible for it.
